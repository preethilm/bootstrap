		Naim Audio isn&apos;t a household name outside of audiophile circles, but this
		British company has for many years made some of the most respected amplifiers in
		the business. Naim long had an informal partnership with Linn, and if the standard
		audio system fitted to Bentley&apos;s ultra-expensive cars isn&apos;t good enough
		for you, the optional audio upgrade is to a Naim system.
